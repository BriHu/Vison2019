# Find Circles Example
#
# This example shows off how to find circles in the image using the Hough
# Transform. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform
#
# Note that the find_circles() method will only find circles which are completely
# inside of the image. Circles which go outside of the image/roi are ignored...

# The below thresholds track in general red/green/blue things. You may wish to tune them...

              (30, 100, -64, -8, -32, 32), # generic_green_thresholds

# Only blobs that with more pixels than "pixel_threshold" and more area than "area_threshold" are
# returned by "find_blobs" below. Change "pixels_threshold" and "area_threshold" if you change the
# camera resolution. "merge=True" merges all overlapping blobs in the image.
